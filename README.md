# EveryThing in JavaScript happens inside an Execution Context.

There are two components of this Execution Context 
   1. Memory Component (Variable Envirnment) - Variable and Functions are stored as key value pairs.
   2. Code Component (Thread of Execution) - Where all code is executed one line at a time.


# JavaScript is a synchronous single threaded language.
    1. single threaded - Execute one command at a time.
    2. synchronous - executed in specific order means it will go to the next line once the current line execution is finished.
